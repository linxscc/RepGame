# RepGame
Please note that this is just a trial project.

Through the creation of a small game, try to realize an automated process, including model, animation, network connection and scene generation.

I did not upload a specific prefab, and importing it directly into the project may cause errors, such as missing references.

The following functions have been implemented:
Automatically generate animator controller.
Automatically generate UI prefabs.
Automatically convert URP shader.
Automatically convert fbx to animation clip.


When you use Network Service in local test,Maybe you will need this command
  net stop winnat
  net start winnat
